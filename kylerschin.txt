I love working on open source because at the end of the day, I felt like I made a difference. Whether it's writing software for Doctors in Africa, Patching Bugs on the Linux Kernal, or helping to secure the Internet with cjdns, A contribution to open source is a contribution to humanity's achivements. Everybody in the community is working together toward a common cause. - From Kyler Chin, @kylerschin. P.S.: Happy Hacktoberfest!
